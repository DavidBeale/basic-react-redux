# Basic technical React / Redux test
## We have put together this very simple test. The fastest completion time is currently 12m 46s.

Please take a look at the below tasks:

- [x] Load the notifications into the component
- [x] Complete toggle notifications logic
- [x] Add functionality to "Toggle show unacknowledged"
- [x] Add functionality to "Acknowledge all"
- [x] Add functionality to "Delete acknowledged"
- [x] Colour the notifications date to #999
- [x] Colour a notification's title red if it is older than 10 days, and still unacknowledged
- [ ] Set opacity for any acknowledged notifications

Once complete, we would prefer it to be uploaded to Github, etc and email us a link to the repo.
If this is not possible, please ZIP the src and email it back to us.
